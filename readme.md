> # Latency Estimation of SSVEP -python

#### SSVEP latency estimation based on paper [1]_.

#### Adapted from https://github.com/iqgnat/SSVEP_phase_latency from MATLAB to python

## Dataset

#### Benchmark dataset [2]_ from Tsinghua university.

## results

#### if everything is ok, you will get the mean_latency â‰ˆ 136ms

#### the result is same as the source code from https://github.com/iqgnat/SSVEP_phase_latency

##### ***2022.6.23  we delete -180 when solving for the phase, which is different from the source code.

## Acknowledgement

#### Thanks to [TangQi]([iqgnat (Tang Qi) (github.com)](https://github.com/iqgnat)), the author of the source code, for his patience in responding to my questions.
